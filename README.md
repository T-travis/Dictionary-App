# Dictionary-App
This is a simple English dictionary web application.  I designed this application to gain experience making 
a RESTful API, along with gaining experience using Nginx, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, AWS EC2, and ended 
up learning quite a bit more to say the least.  The dictionary is based on this repo [matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary) which contains 
Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary (from the Gutenberg Project, compiled August 22, 2009).
