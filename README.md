# Dictionary-API-App
What is this app?  A simple web based English dictionary application.  Why bother making such a simple application?
I designed this application to gain experience with Nginx, Express.js, AWS EC2, and ended up learning
quite a bit more to say the least.  The dictionary is based on this repo [matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary) 
which contains Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary (from the Gutenberg Project, compiled August 22, 2009).
